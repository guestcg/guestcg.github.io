  <p>Even those who discarded the technology of smart homes as unrealistic toys for lazy youngsters are finding it increasingly difficult to resist the charms of smart home devices with IoT.</p>
  <p>These devices will be very popular in 2019 and coming years as they become highly intuitive and innovative and extend not only to the comfort of home automation but also to home security and the safety of your family.</p>
  <p>Dryers that warn you when the accumulation of lint gets too high can prevent a fire. Thatâ€™s the kind of smart home functionality that will see a big adoption in 2019 and coming years.</p>
  <p>Another big driver of smart IoT development adoption is the need to save energy. Intelligent thermostats and smart lighting help conserve energy and reduce bills, which will be another great reason why more and more people turn to IoT devices in 2019 and beyond.</p>
