 <h4>Choosing Project Management methodologies for software development</h4>
 <p>Planning is the key to success. The project management methodology you choose will dictate how the rest of the project will perform. This includes preparing, planning, monitoring and controlling the activities needed to finish the tasks.</p>
 <p>When it comes to project management, there are a lot of choices and each comes with its own set of rules, principles, processes, pros and cons, and more.</p>
 <p>One important thing to keep in mind, however, is that there is no “perfect” or one-size-fits-all methodology. Each project management methodology has its own requirements and practices that make it ideal for a specific occasion.</p>
 <p>For software development specifically, there is a lot of talk on how to guide development. Each development project and client are different. The differences range in the deadlines, time-frame, budget, and more.</p>
 <p>This is why you need to think about the specific project requirements and goals before diving into it. In turn, this will impact how your coding sessions and developing your tasks will go.</p>
