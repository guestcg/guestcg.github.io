    <h1>Design Trends (User View)</h1>
    <p>Graphic designers Loredana Papp-Dinea and Mihai Baldean from Milo Themes have compiled a comprehensive and extensive list of 2019 trends in graphic design, UI/UX design, typography, branding/logo design, motion graphics, and packaging design. They&#8217;ve listed visual examples of each trend and its subcategories, using contemporary work created by leading designers and studios.</p>
    <p>Popular trends across formats include custom-made illustrations, bright colors and gradients, bold fonts and typography, asymmetrical shapes and layouts, and more.</p>
    <p>A major trend in web and UI design is to create a website for mobile first, then desktop. This should come as no surprise as mobile devices are now the leading source of website traffic worldwide (52.2%, source: Statista).</p>
    <p>Packaging design is shifting towards a more environment-friendly approach with the use of natural, recyclable, and bio-based materials. Check out the complete trend report below.</p>
